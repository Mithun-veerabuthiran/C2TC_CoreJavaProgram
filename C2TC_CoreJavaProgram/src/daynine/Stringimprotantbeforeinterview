The difference lies in how String objects are created and stored in Java.

### 1. Normal String Assignment (String Pool)
```java
String s1 = "TNSIF";
String s2 = "TNSIF";
```
- Both s1 and s2 refer to the **same object** in the String pool if the value is the same.
- Example: s1 == s2 is true (they point to the same memory location).
- Efficient in terms of memory.

### 2. Using new String() Constructor
```java
String s3 = new String("TNSIF");
String s4 = new String("TNSIF");
```
- Each statement creates a **new object** in the heap, even if the value is the same.
- s3 and s4 point to **different objects** in memory.
- Example: s3 == s4 is false (different memory locations), but s3.equals(s4) is true (same value).

### Summary Table

| Code Example                      | Stored In      | == Comparison | .equals() Comparison |
|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| String s1 = "TNSIF";               | String pool   | s1 == s2: true| s1.equals(s2): true  |
| String s2 = "TNSIF";               | String pool   |               |                      |
| String s3 = new String("TNSIF");   | Heap          | s3 == s4: false| s3.equals(s4): true |
| String s4 = new String("TNSIF");   | Heap          |               |                      |

**Key point:**  
- `"TNSIF"` uses the String pool (efficient, shared).
- `new String("TNSIF")` always makes a new object (not shared).

Let's break down what each line does and what the output will be, assuming s1 and s2 are defined as follows in your StringComparision.java file (based on common practice and naming):

Suppose:
```java
String s1 = "TNSIF";
String s2 = "TNSIF";
```

Here's the explanation for each line:

1. **System.out.println(s1.compareTo("tnsif"));**
   - compareTo() compares two strings lexicographically (dictionary order), considering case (i.e., 'T' vs 't').
   - "TNSIF" vs "tnsif": ASCII value of 'T' is 84, 't' is 116.
   - The result will be 84 - 116 = **-32**
   - Output: `-32`

2. **System.out.println(s1.compareToIgnoreCase("tnsif"));**
   - compareToIgnoreCase() compares strings lexicographically, ignoring case.
   - "TNSIF" and "tnsif" are the same when case is ignored.
   - Output: **0**

3. **System.out.println(s1.compareTo(s2));**
   - Both s1 and s2 are "TNSIF", so they are exactly equal.
   - Output: **0**

**Summary of Output:**
```
-32
0
0
```

**Why:**
- The first line gives a negative value because uppercase 'T' is less than lowercase 't' in ASCII.
- The second line gives 0 because compareToIgnoreCase ignores case and the strings are the same.
- The third line gives 0 because both strings are exactly the same.

If s1 and s2 have different values in your code, let me know their actual contents for an exact output!












That’s a **great beginner-level question** — and yes, it can be confusing at first!
You wrote:

```java
String s1 = "mithun";
String s = "mithun";
```

There’s **no error** — and you're wondering **why** and what exactly is happening behind the scenes. Let's explain clearly and simply.

---

## 🔍 What’s Really Happening?

Both `s1` and `s` are using **string literals**.

```java
String s1 = "mithun";
String s = "mithun";
```

In Java, when you create a string like `"mithun"` without `new`, Java **reuses the same object** from the **String Pool** to save memory.

---

## ✅ What is the **String Pool**?

The **String Pool** is a special area in Java memory where **string literals** are stored.

When you do:

```java
String s1 = "mithun";
String s = "mithun";
```

Java thinks:

> “Hey, I already have a `"mithun"` string in the pool — so I’ll just point `s` to the **same object** as `s1`.”

---

### 🔍 Memory Diagram (Simplified)

```
   String Pool:
   --------------
   "mithun" <--- both s1 and s point to the same object
     ↑   ↑
     |   |
    s1   s
```

So both `s1` and `s` are pointing to **exactly the same string object**.

---

## 🤔 Let’s Test It

```java
public class TestStrings {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "mithun";
        String s = "mithun";

        System.out.println(s1 == s);         // true (same object)
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s));    // true (same content)
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
true
true
```

* `==` checks **object reference** (same memory → true)
* `.equals()` checks **string content** (same text → true)

---

## ⚠️ What if You Use `new`?

```java
String s2 = new String("mithun");
System.out.println(s1 == s2);         // false
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));    // true
```

### Why?

* `s2` creates a **new object in heap memory**, so it's not the same object as `s1`.
* But they both still **contain the same characters**, so `.equals()` is `true`.

---

## ✅ Final Summary

| Statement                | What it does                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `String s1 = "mithun";`  | Stores "mithun" in the String Pool            |
| `String s = "mithun";`   | Reuses the same string from the pool          |
| No error?                | ✅ Because Java allows reusing string literals |
| Same object (`==`)?      | ✅ Yes                                         |
| Same value (`.equals()`) | ✅ Yes                                         |

You're doing great exploring Java string methods! Let's **break each line** down like a complete beginner. You used:

```java
String s1 = new String("  Indian  ");
System.out.println(s1.trim());
System.out.println(s1.strip());
System.out.println(s1.stripTrailing());
System.out.println(s1.isEmpty());
```

---

### 🔹 Full String

```java
String s1 = "  Indian  ";
```

This string has:

* 2 spaces **at the beginning**
* The word **"Indian"**
* 2 spaces **at the end**

So the string looks like:

```
[ ][ ] [I][n][d][i][a][n] [ ][ ]
```

---

## ✅ Now, let’s explain each method:

---

### 1️⃣ `s1.trim()`

```java
System.out.println(s1.trim());
```

* **Removes spaces** from the **start and end only**.
* Inside spaces (if any) stay untouched.

🧠 Think of `trim()` as a basic space remover from edges.

🔹 Input: `"  Indian  "`
🔹 Output: `"Indian"`

---

### 2️⃣ `s1.strip()`

```java
System.out.println(s1.strip());
```

* Same purpose as `trim()` — removes leading and trailing whitespace.
* ✅ But it also works better for **Unicode spaces** (international characters).

💡 For regular English spaces, `strip()` and `trim()` give the **same result**.

🔹 Output: `"Indian"`

---

### 3️⃣ `s1.stripTrailing()`

```java
System.out.println(s1.stripTrailing());
```

* Removes only the **ending spaces**.
* Keeps the **beginning spaces** untouched.

🔹 Output: `"  Indian"`
(starts with spaces, ends clean)

---

### 4️⃣ `s1.isEmpty()`

```java
System.out.println(s1.isEmpty());
```

* Checks if the **string has 0 characters**.

But in your case:

```java
String s1 = "  Indian  ";
```

It has 10 characters — including spaces.

🔹 So result is: `false`

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Method            | What It Does                   | Output on `"  Indian  "` |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `trim()`          | Removes start & end spaces     | `"Indian"`               |
| `strip()`         | Same as trim, Unicode-aware    | `"Indian"`               |
| `stripTrailing()` | Removes only **ending** spaces | `"  Indian"`             |
| `isEmpty()`       | Checks if string is empty      | `false`                  |

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tip:

Want to remove **all spaces** (even in the middle)?

```java
System.out.println(s1.replace(" ", ""));
```

🔹 Output: `"Indian"`
