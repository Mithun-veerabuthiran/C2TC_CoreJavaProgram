private Bank bank



Great question! Let's break it down in a **very beginner-friendly** way. We'll explain:

1. What `private Bank bank;` means
2. Why we use it
3. How to use it with a **simple real-world example**

---

### 🔹 1. What is `private Bank bank;`?

It's a **declaration of a variable** in Java.

* `private`: an **access modifier** that means only this class can access it.
* `Bank`: this is a **class name** (maybe a class you created).
* `bank`: this is the **variable name**, an **object** of type `Bank`.

So, it means:

> "This class has a private variable named `bank`, which is an object of the `Bank` class."

---

### 🔹 2. Why do we use it?

We use this to **create a connection between classes**.

Let’s say we are building a program like:

> A `Customer` has a `Bank` account.

We make a `Bank` class and store a `Bank` object inside the `Customer` class like this:

```java
public class Customer {
    private Bank bank;  // This means each customer has a Bank account.
}
```

We make it `private` so **other classes can't directly access or change it**. This is called **encapsulation** — hiding details and exposing only what's needed using `getters` and `setters`.

### 🔹 3. Full Example (Beginner Friendly)

#### ✅ Step 1: Create the `Bank` class

```java
public class Bank {
    private String bankName;

    public Bank(String name) {
        this.bankName = name;
    }

    public String getBankName() {
        return bankName;
    }

    public void setBankName(String name) {
        this.bankName = name;
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Step 2: Create the `Customer` class

```java
public class Customer {
    private String name;
    private Bank bank;  // <- This is your line

    public Customer(String name, Bank bank) {
        this.name = name;
        this.bank = bank;
    }

    public void showCustomerDetails() {
        System.out.println("Customer Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Bank Name: " + bank.getBankName());  // accessing Bank object
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Step 3: Create a `Main` class to run it

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bank b1 = new Bank("State Bank of India");
        Customer c1 = new Customer("Mithun", b1);

        c1.showCustomerDetails();
    }
}
```

#### 🖨 Output:

```
Customer Name: Mithun
Bank Name: State Bank of India
```
