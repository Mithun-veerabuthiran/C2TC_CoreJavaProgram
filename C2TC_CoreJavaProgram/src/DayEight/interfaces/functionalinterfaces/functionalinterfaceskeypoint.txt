The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation in Java is used to **indicate that an interface is a Functional Interface**.

---

### 🔹 What is a Functional Interface?

A **Functional Interface** is an interface that contains **exactly one abstract method**.

👉 These interfaces can be used as the **target types for lambda expressions and method references** (introduced in Java 8).

---

### 🔸 Purpose of `@FunctionalInterface`

* It **marks an interface as functional**, making the code **clear and intentional**.
* It helps the compiler catch errors:
  If you try to add more than one abstract method to a functional interface, the compiler will throw an **error**.

---

### ✅ Basic Example (For Beginners)

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();  // only one abstract method
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Lambda expression implementing the sayHello method
        Greeting greet = () -> System.out.println("Hello, welcome to Java!");
        greet.sayHello();
    }
}
```

---

### 🔍 Why Use `@FunctionalInterface`?

1. ✅ **Clarity**: Signals the intent that this interface is meant for lambda use.
2. ✅ **Compile-time safety**: Prevents you from accidentally adding another abstract method.
3. ✅ **Works with Lambdas and Functional Programming** in Java.

---

### ⚠️ Example That Causes an Error

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Invalid {
    void method1();
    void method2();  // ❌ ERROR: More than one abstract method
}
```

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functional Interface | Interface with **one abstract method**                                    |
| @FunctionalInterface | Tells compiler and reader that this interface is meant for **lambda use** |
| Lambda               | Shorthand way to write a class with a single method                       |

The usage of the functionalInterface of the lambda :


Great question! Let’s break this line down clearly for a **beginner**:

```java
// using Lambda Expression
GreetInterface g1 = () -> {
    return "Good Afternoon";
};
```

---

## 🔹 What's happening here step-by-step?

### 🔸 1. **What is `GreetInterface`?**

It must be a **functional interface** — meaning it has **only one abstract method**.

Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface GreetInterface {
    String greet();  // Only one abstract method
}
```

This interface says: "Any class (or lambda) that implements me must provide a `greet()` method that returns a `String`."

---

### 🔸 2. **What is this doing?**

```java
GreetInterface g1 = () -> {
    return "Good Afternoon";
};
```

This is using a **lambda expression** to **implement** the interface method (`greet()`) **without writing a full class**.

👉 `() -> { return "Good Afternoon"; }` is a **lambda expression**. It means:

> "When someone calls my `greet()` method, return 'Good Afternoon'."

So:

* `()` = no parameters.
* `->` = "maps to".
* `{ return "Good Afternoon"; }` = body of the method.

---

### 🔸 3. What happens **at `GreetInterface`**?

Behind the scenes, Java converts this lambda into an **object** of a class that implements `GreetInterface`. So:

```java
GreetInterface g1 = () -> { return "Good Afternoon"; };
```

Is equivalent to:

```java
GreetInterface g1 = new GreetInterface() {
    public String greet() {
        return "Good Afternoon";
    }
};
```

But the **lambda version is shorter and cleaner**.

---

## ✅ Final Output Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface GreetInterface {
    String greet();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GreetInterface g1 = () -> {
            return "Good Afternoon";
        };

        System.out.println(g1.greet());  // Output: Good Afternoon
    }
}
```

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@FunctionalInterface`    | Ensures only one abstract method exists                                          |
| Lambda `() -> { ... }`    | Short form of method implementation                                              |
| `GreetInterface g1 = ...` | You're assigning a **function** (lambda) as an object implementing the interface |
