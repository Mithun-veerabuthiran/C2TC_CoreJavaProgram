ArrayOperations to understand it:
Absolutely! Let’s walk through your Java code **line by line** and explain it in a very beginner-friendly way. You’ll understand everything clearly — I’ll even break it into simple parts.

---

### 🚀 Part 1: `printArray` method

```java
static void printArray(int[] arr) {
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
		System.out.print(arr[i] + "\t");
	System.out.println();
}
```

✅ **What it does**:
This method **prints each element** in an array of integers.

🧠 **How it works**:

* `int[] arr`: this means the method accepts an **array of integers**.
* `arr.length`: gets the **number of elements** in the array.
* The `for` loop goes from 0 to the last index of the array.
* `System.out.print(arr[i] + "\t")`: prints each element with a **tab space** between them.
* `System.out.println()`: moves the cursor to the next line after printing.

📦 **Example**:

```java
int[] numbers = {2, 4, 6};
printArray(numbers);
```

🖨️ Output:

```
2	4	6	
```

### 🌟 Part 2: `getSum` method

```java
public static int getSum(int... n) {
	int sum = 0;
	for (int no : n)
		sum += no;
	return sum;
}
```

✅ **What it does**:
This method returns the **sum of all numbers** passed to it.

🧠 **How it works**:

* `int... n` is called **varargs** (variable arguments).

  * You can pass any number of integers: `getSum(1, 2, 3, 4)`.
* `for (int no : n)` is a **for-each loop**: it goes through each number in `n`.
* It adds each number to `sum` and returns the total.

📦 **Example**:

```java
int total = getSum(1, 2, 3, 4);
System.out.println(total);
```

🖨️ Output:

```
10
```

### 🔢 Part 3: `getOddCount` method

```java
public static int getOddCount(int b[]) {
	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
		if (b[i] % 2 != 0)
			count++;
	}
	return count;
}
```

✅ **What it does**:
This method counts how many **odd numbers** are in the array.

🧠 **How it works**:

* It loops through each number in array `b`.
* Checks if number is **odd**: `b[i] % 2 != 0`

  * `%` is modulus (remainder).
  * Example: `5 % 2 = 1`, `6 % 2 = 0`.
* If it’s odd, it increases the `count`.

📦 **Example**:

```java
int[] nums = {1, 4, 7, 8};
int oddCount = getOddCount(nums);
System.out.println(oddCount);
```

🖨️ Output:

```
2
```

(Odd numbers are 1 and 7)

---

### 🔢 Part 4: `getEvenCount` method

```java
public static int getEvenCount(int b[]) {
	return b.length - getOddCount(b);
}
```

✅ **What it does**:
This method counts how many **even numbers** are in the array.

🧠 **How it works**:

* Total elements = `b.length`
* Odd elements = `getOddCount(b)`
* So, even = total − odd

📦 **Example**:

```java
int[] nums = {1, 4, 7, 8};
int evenCount = getEvenCount(nums);
System.out.println(evenCount);
```

🖨️ Output:

```
2
```

(Even numbers are 4 and 8)

### ✅ Summary for You (as a Beginner):

| Method Name    | What It Does                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `printArray`   | Prints all numbers in the array            |
| `getSum(...)`  | Adds all numbers given and returns the sum |
| `getOddCount`  | Counts how many numbers in array are odd   |
| `getEvenCount` | Counts how many are even (by total − odd)  |

Would you like me to add a simple `main()` function to test all of these together?
