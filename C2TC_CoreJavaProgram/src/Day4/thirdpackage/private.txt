private:
Great question! Let's break it down:

### 🔁 Code in focus:

```java
private static MyClass obj = new MyClass();
```

This line is **key to implementing the Singleton design pattern** in Java.

---

### ✅ Purpose of this line:

This line ensures that:

1. **Only one instance** of `MyClass` is **created and stored** in the static variable `obj`.
2. It is created **eagerly**, meaning: the instance is created **as soon as the class is loaded** into memory.
3. It is marked `private` so that **no other class can access or create it directly**.
4. It is `static`, which means it's associated with the **class itself**, not with any object—this allows the static method `getObject()` to return it.

---

### 🔒 Why `private constructor`?

```java
private MyClass() {
    System.out.println("MyClass object created");
}
```

This **prevents other classes from creating new instances** of `MyClass` using `new MyClass()`—which is what enforces the Singleton pattern.

---

### 🏭 Why `getObject()` method?

```java
public static MyClass getObject() {
    return obj;
}
```

This is a **factory method**. It provides **controlled access** to the single instance of `MyClass`. Other classes **must use this method** to get the instance.

### 💡 Summary:

| Part                                          | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `private static MyClass obj = new MyClass();` | Eagerly creates the **one and only** object of `MyClass` |
| `private MyClass()`                           | Prevents external instantiation                          |
| `public static MyClass getObject()`           | Provides global access point to the single instance      |

---

### 🔄 Example Usage:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass m1 = MyClass.getObject();
        MyClass m2 = MyClass.getObject();

        m1.setId(101);
        System.out.println(m1); // MyClass [id=101]
        System.out.println(m2); // MyClass [id=101] --> same object as m1!
        
        System.out.println(m1 == m2); // true
    }
}
```

Let me know if you want a version with lazy initialization (object created only when needed).
